[Kafka manager](http://edbaker.weebly.com/blog/install-and-evaluation-of-yahoos-kafka-manager): Conclusion: As I started playing around with Kafka Manager it became apparent to me that this tool was only intended to be used as a UI for administration tasks, not for monitoring health (such as lag) of existing production topics. So soon enough I will also be looking at web-console.
